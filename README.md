## FAQ

Q: Which release of a given program do I pick?  
A: Short answer? *It depends.* Long answer? Go with the most stable, most up-to-date, least headache-inducing release. Typically Flatpaks as they're the most portable release, but you could face some issues due to their sandboxed nature (see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/flathub/org.keepassxc.KeePassXC/issues/29) as example).  
Otherwise, go with native RPMs. I'd avoid AppImages as they're a bit of a hassle to organize (maybe use [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher)?).

Q: What about atomic distributions?  
A: Not for me. If you are interested though, you will likely rather [UBlue](https://universal-blue.org/)'s releases to Fedora's.

Q: Where to find the answers?  
A: [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page), [Fedora Quick Docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/), [RHEL Docs](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/).
