## FAQ

Q: Which release of a given program do I pick?  
A: Short answer? *It depends.* Long answer? Go with the most stable, most up-to-date, least headache-inducing release. Typically Flatpaks as they're the most portable release, but you could face some issues due to their sandboxed nature (see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/flathub/org.keepassxc.KeePassXC/issues/29) as example).  
Otherwise, go with native RPMs. I'd avoid AppImages as they're a bit of a hassle to organize (maybe use [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher)?).

Q: What about atomic distributions?  
A: I haven't ever tried one, but I believe you shouldn't go with Fedora's relases (Silverblue, Kinoite, etc.) but with [Universal Blue's](https://universal-blue.org/).

Q: Where to find the answers?  
A: [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page), [Fedora Quick Docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/), [RHEL Docs](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/), [Google](https://www.google.com/) and/or [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
