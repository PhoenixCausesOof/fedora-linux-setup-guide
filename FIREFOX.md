# Firefox Setup

For those who don't want to get made fun of.

## Set up your `user.js`

The default Firefox settings are... *not-good*. The easiest way to fix that is by using pre-made settings (through a file called `user.js`).

You'll probably want [yokoffing/Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) for a positive experience overall.

If you're looking to "maximize 'privacy'", do so with [arkenfox/user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js). For harcore users though, it might be even better to go with Mullvad Browser or plain ol' [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

## Extensions

Read: <https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions>

As a general rule of thumb, pick open-source extensions over closed-source ones.
