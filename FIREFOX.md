# Firefox Setup

For those who don't want to get made fun of.

## Set up your `user.js`

If you don't want to run Mullvad Browser or Tor Browser, but wish to maximize privacy, use [arkenfox/user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js).

Otherwise, you'll probably want [yokoffing/Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) for a positive experience overall.

## Extensions

Read: <https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions>

As a general rule of thumb, pick open-source extensions over closed-source ones.
